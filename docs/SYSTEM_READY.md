## 🐛 **Known Quality Issues (from previous testing):**

The existing completed jobs show these problems:

### **SaaS Metrics 2.0** (8,391 words):
❌ **Too much content** - Should be ~3,500 words
❌ **Navigation menus** - "Skip to content", "Posts", "Categories", "Tags"
❌ **JavaScript code** - HubSpot forms not removed
❌ **Page structure** - Navigation, menus, social sharing buttons included

### **What Should Happen:**
- **Python baseline** (clean): 3,500 words, no nav, no JS
- **Go worker** (current): 8,391 words, has nav, has JS, has extra content

**This is exactly what the UI helps you debug!**

---

## 🔍 **How to Use the UI for Debugging:**

### **1. Check Completed Jobs:**
```
Dashboard → Click "SaaS Metrics 2.0" → See quality warnings
```
The UI will automatically show:
- ⚠️ Navigation menus detected
- ⚠️ JavaScript code not removed
- ⚠️ 138% more content than expected

### **2. View Comparison:**
```
Job Detail → "View Comparison" button
```
Side-by-side view shows:
- **Left**: Go worker output (with problems)
- **Right**: Python baseline (clean)
- **Metrics**: Word count difference, issue count

### **3. Extract New Articles:**
```
Dashboard → Enter URL → Click "Extract"
```
Watch in real-time:
- Job created (⚪ queued)
- Worker processing (🟡 processing)
- Completed or failed (🟢 completed / 🔴 failed)

### **4. Analyze Results:**
```
Click the job → Review preview → Check quality warnings
```
First 2000 characters show clearly if navigation/JS is present

- [ ] Test download functionality
- [ ] Verify API key works
