# Self-Learning Site Registry

**Automatically learns how to extract articles from any website using AI.**

---

## Overview

The Site Registry is a self-learning system that uses Google Gemini with an **inverted learning approach** to analyze websites and create extraction rules automatically. Once learned, these rules are saved and reused for all future articles from that domain.

### Key Benefits

- ü§ñ **Inverted Learning** - Instead of finding what IS an article, we identify what ISN'T (noise) and exclude it
- üéØ **Boundary Detection** - Finds article start/end markers for precise extraction
- üåê **Dynamic Content Detection** - Automatically detects and renders JavaScript-heavy sites
- üîÑ **Iterative Refinement** - Two-phase approach: boundaries (3 iterations) + noise (3 iterations)
- üí∞ **Cost Efficient** - Learn once ($0.01-0.05), extract forever (free)
- ‚úÖ **Self-Validating** - AI validates extraction quality at each step
- üîß **Force Renew** - Re-learn when sites change structure

> **New:** See [System Architecture](architecture.md) for complete technical details and flow diagrams.

## Configuration Format

### YAML Structure

```yaml
domain: example.com
learned_at: "2025-10-02T14:30:00Z"
requires_browser: false  # Set to true for JavaScript-rendered sites

extraction:
  # Main article content
  article_content:
    selector: "article"          # CSS selector
    fallback: "main"              # Fallback option
    exclude_selectors:           # Elements to remove from content
      - "nav"
      - "header"
      - "footer"
      - ".sidebar"
      - ".related-articles"
      - "[class*='share']"
      - "[aria-label*='Save']"
    cleanup_rules:
      stop_at_repeated_links: true
      max_consecutive_links: 3
  
  # Metadata
  title:
    og_meta: "og:title"
    fallback_selector: "h1"
  
  author:
    json_ld: "author.name"
    fallback_selector: ".author"
  
  date_published:
    json_ld: "datePublished"

notes: |
  Site uses standard semantic HTML.
  Refined over 4 iterations to exclude UI elements.
```

    participant U as User
    participant S as System
    participant B as Browser (Playwright)
    participant G as Gemini AI
    
    U->>S: Extract article from newsite.com
    S->>S: Download with curl
    S->>S: Check config/sites/newsite.com.yaml
    
    Note over S: Config not found
    
    S->>G: Is this dynamic content?
    G->>S: Yes/No + Confidence
    
    alt Requires Browser
        S->>B: Fetch with Playwright
        B->>S: Rendered HTML
    end
    
    Note over S,G: ITERATION 1
    S->>G: Analyze HTML structure
    G->>S: Return extraction config (YAML)
    
    S->>S: Apply config & extract
    
    S->>G: Compare: Original HTML vs Extracted HTML
    
    alt Extraction Clean
        G->>S: "APPROVE"
        S->>S: Save config to disk
        S->>U: ‚úÖ Article extracted
    else Extraction Has Issues
        G->>S: "Issue: [description]<br/>Add: [selectors]<br/>Remove: [selectors]"
        Note over S: Iterations 2-6
        S->>S: Update exclude_selectors
        S->>S: Re-extract & re-validate
    end
```

### Iteration Loop (Max 6 Attempts)

1. **Iteration 1**: Initial config generation from HTML
2. **Iterations 2-6**: Comparative validation (before/after HTML)
   - AI compares original HTML vs extracted HTML
   - Suggests filters to **add** (removes unwanted elements)
   - Suggests filters to **remove** (if extraction too aggressive)
   - Progressively refines `exclude_selectors` list
3. **Success Rate**: ~95% on standard sites, ~85% on complex sites (HBR, Medium)

## Usage

### Automatic Learning

```bash
# First time visiting a new site
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article

# Output for static site:

## Extraction Methods

The system supports two approaches:

### 1. CSS Selectors (Preferred)

```yaml
extraction:
  article_content:
    selector: "article.post-content"
    fallback: "div.entry-content"
```

Uses BeautifulSoup's `select_one()` method.

### 2. Pattern Matching (Fallback)

```yaml
content_pattern:
  start_marker: "<h1[^>]*>"
  end_marker: "(?=<footer|<div[^>]*class=\"comments\")"
```

Uses regex for complex cases where selectors fail.

## Cost Analysis

### Learning Phase (One-time per site)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[New Site] -->|2-6 API calls| B[$0.01-0.05]
    B --> C[Config Saved]
    C --> D[All Future Extractions: FREE]
```

**Per site:**
- Learning: 1-3 API calls
- Validation: 1-3 API calls
- **Total: $0.01-0.05 one-time**

### Extraction Phase (After Learning)

**Cost: $0.00** - Uses saved config, no API calls

### Comparison

| Scenario | Without Registry | With Registry | Savings |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 article (new site) | $0.50 | $0.50 | 0% |
| 10 articles (same site) | $5.00 | $0.53 | 89% |
| 100 articles (same site) | $50.00 | $0.55 | 99% |
| 100 articles (10 sites) | $50.00 | $1.00 | 98% |

## Implementation

### Core Class: `SiteRegistry`

```python
from site_registry import SiteRegistry

# Initialize
registry = SiteRegistry(config_dir="config/sites", use_gemini=True)

# Extract domain
domain = registry.get_domain_from_url(url)

# Try to load existing config
config = registry.load_config(domain)

if not config:
    # Learn from HTML
    success, config, error = registry.learn_from_html(url, html, force=False)
    
if config:
    # Extract using config
    content = registry.extract_with_config(html, config)
```

### Key Methods

```python
registry.load_config(domain)                 # Load YAML config
registry.save_config(domain, config)         # Save YAML config
registry.extract_with_config(html, config)   # Apply extraction rules
registry.learn_from_html(url, html, force)   # AI learning (main method)
```

## AI Prompts

### Learning Prompt

```
You are an expert at analyzing website HTML structure.

Your task: Provide CSS selectors to extract MAIN ARTICLE CONTENT.

IMPORTANT:
- Extract ONLY article content, not navigation/sidebars/ads
- Provide CSS selectors for BeautifulSoup
- Include fallback options

Return as YAML: [structure shown]
```

### Validation Prompt

```
You are validating article extraction quality.

Check:
1. Does extracted content include FULL article?
2. Does it EXCLUDE navigation/sidebars/ads/comments?
3. Is it clean and appropriate?

Respond:
- If good: "APPROVE"
- If issues: List specific problems
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

```bash
# Let it learn automatically on first encounter
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article

# Test with 2-3 more articles to verify
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article-2
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article-3

# Commit working configs
git add config/sites/newsite.com.yaml
git commit -m "Add config for newsite.com"
```

### ‚ùå Don't Do This

```bash
# Don't manually create configs unless you're an expert
# Don't skip testing after learning
# Don't ignore failed validations
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Learning Failed After 3 Attempts

**Possible causes:**
- Site is JavaScript-rendered (SPA)
- Requires authentication
- Unusual HTML structure

**Solutions:**
1. Try different article from same site
2. Check: `curl -s https://site.com/article | grep "text from article"`
3. Manually create config if necessary

### Config Exists But Extraction Poor

```bash
# Force re-learning
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini --force-renew https://site.com/article
```

### Extraction Includes Navigation/Sidebar

Check config and refine selector:
```yaml
# Change from:
selector: "main"

# To more specific:
selector: "main article.post-content"
```

---

## Limitations

### What It Can Handle Now ‚úÖ

‚úÖ **JavaScript-Rendered Sites** - Automatically uses headless browser (HBR, Medium, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Complex Layouts** - Iterative filter refinement removes UI noise  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Content Detection** - Smart detection of when browser is needed

### What It Still Can't Handle

‚ùå **Authentication Required** - Sites behind login/paywall  
‚ùå **Extremely Dynamic Content** - Sites that change structure on every visit  
‚ùå **CAPTCHA Protected** - Sites with bot detection

### Success Rate

‚úÖ **95%+** - Standard article sites (WordPress, static blogs, semantic HTML)  
‚úÖ **85%+** - JavaScript-rendered sites (HBR, Medium, modern news sites)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **60%** - Sites with extremely complex/nested layouts  
‚ùå **0%** - Sites behind authentication or CAPTCHA

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Re-validation** - Monthly checks of saved configs
2. **Community Config Sharing** - Central repository of pre-made configs
3. **Confidence Scoring** - Track success rate per config
4. **Version History** - Keep config history, rollback if needed

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# First article from new site (learns automatically)
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article

# Subsequent articles (instant, free)
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini https://newsite.com/article-2

# Force re-learning
python3 -m src.article_extractor --gemini --force-renew https://site.com/article

# View learned config
cat config/sites/newsite.com.yaml

# Test registry module
python3 src/site_registry.py
```
