## Part 1: Looking at a single new sales hire

### How revenue builds for a single sales hire, assuming no ramp up time

For those new to SaaS or other recurring revenue businesses, the graph below shows one of the delightful things about recurring revenue. Bookings made in January, continue to be billed in every subsequent month. The chart on the left shows this effect assuming no churn rate (or loss of customers). The graph on the right shows the impact of a 2.5% monthly churn rate, which slowly eats away amount that billed monthly.

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 1/8]**

Two Stacked Bar Charts comparing Monthly Billed Revenue (MRR) over a year, with and without customer churn. Both charts display months from January to December on the X-axis and Monthly Billed Revenue in U.S. dollars on the Y-axis, ranging from $0 to $45,000 in $5,000 increments. Each segment of the stacked bars represents the revenue contributed by a customer cohort acquired in a specific month, as indicated by the legend (e.g., "Jan Custs," "Feb Custs," through "Dec Custs").

**Left Chart: With no Churn**
This chart visualizes the cumulative growth of MRR when there is no customer churn.
* **Pattern:** The total monthly billed revenue increases consistently and significantly each month, as revenue from newly acquired customers is added to the full, undiminished revenue from all previous customer cohorts.
* **Data Points:**
* In January, the MRR is approximately $3,500, contributed solely by January customers.
* By June, the MRR reaches approximately $20,500.
* By December, the total MRR culminates at approximately $41,000. Each monthly customer cohort (Jan through Dec) contributes roughly an equal amount to the total MRR in December (around $3,500 to $4,000 per cohort). For example, the "Jan Custs" segment in the December bar is approximately $3,500, similar to its initial contribution in January.

**Right Chart: With Churn of 2.5%**
This chart visualizes the cumulative growth of MRR with an assumed monthly churn rate of 2.5%.
* **Pattern:** Similar to the no-churn scenario, the total monthly billed revenue generally increases, but the rate of increase is slower, and the total MRR is lower in later months due to the attrition of existing customers. The contribution of older customer cohorts visibly shrinks over time within the stacked bars.
* **Data Points:**
* In January, the MRR is approximately $3,500, identical to the no-churn scenario.
* By June, the MRR reaches approximately $19,500, slightly less than the no-churn scenario for the same month.
* By December, the total MRR is approximately $36,000, which is about $5,000 lower than the no-churn scenario for December. The "Jan Custs" segment in the December bar is visibly smaller than in the no-churn chart, illustrating the impact of churn reducing revenue from the earliest customer cohort over the year. Each subsequent month's customer cohort also shows a diminishing contribution in the total MRR for December compared to their initial bookings.

**Overall Insight:** The comparison clearly demonstrates that while recurring revenue businesses benefit from cumulative growth, even a modest 2.5% monthly churn rate significantly impacts the total MRR generated over a year, leading to a substantial difference of about $5,000 in total monthly revenue by December in this example.

### Bookings, Churn, and MRR for a new sales hire

The above graphs assume no ramp up time. Lets take a look at bookings, churn, and  MRR for a new sales hire:

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 2/8]**

**Stacked Bar Charts: Bookings & Churn, and Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for a Single Sales Hire**

This visualization presents two stacked bar charts side-by-side, tracking the performance metrics for a single sales hire over 12 months.

**Chart 1: Bookings & Churn – Single Sales Hire**
This is a stacked bar chart illustrating monthly New MRR added and Churn.
* **X-axis:** Months, from Month 1 to Month 12.
* **Y-axis:** Dollars, ranging from $(1,000) to $3,500.
* **Components:**
* "New MRR added this month" is represented by light green/yellow bars, shown as positive values above the zero line.
* "Churn" is represented by orange/brown bars, shown as negative values below the zero line.

**Key Patterns and Data:**
* **New MRR Added:** The "New MRR added this month" ramps up significantly over the first four months.
* Month 1: Approximately $250.
* Month 2: Approximately $950.
* Month 3: Approximately $1,950.
* Month 4: Reaches approximately $2,950.
* From Month 4 to Month 12, the new MRR added each month remains stable at approximately $2,950.
* **Churn:** The "Churn" component starts small and gradually increases over time.
* Month 1 and 2: No visible churn.
* Month 3: Churn is approximately $(50).
* Month 4: Churn is approximately $(100).
* Month 5: Churn is approximately $(150).
* Month 12: Churn grows to approximately $(350).
* **Overall Trend:** This chart shows a sales hire's new bookings reaching full productivity by Month 4, while churn consistently grows as the customer base expands.

**Chart 2: MRR – Single Sales Hire**
This is a cumulative stacked bar chart displaying the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and its contributing components.
* **X-axis:** Months, from Month 1 to Month 12.
* **Y-axis:** Dollars, ranging from $(5,000) to $30,000.
* **Components:**
* "Churn" is represented by brown segments at the bottom of the stack.
* "New MRR added this month" is represented by light green/yellow segments, stacked above churn.
* "MRR from prior months bookings" is represented by dark green/olive segments, forming the top portion of the stack.

**Key Patterns and Data:**
* **Overall MRR Growth:** The total MRR (represented by the combined height of the stacked bars) shows a steady, increasing trend month-over-month.
* Month 1: Total MRR is approximately $250.
* Month 3: Total MRR is approximately $3,100.
* Month 6: Total MRR is approximately $12,000.
* Month 12: Total MRR reaches approximately $27,000.
* **Component Contributions:**
* **New MRR added this month (light yellow):** This component shows a similar ramp-up as in the first chart, reaching approximately $2,950 by Month 4 and remaining stable thereafter.
* **MRR from prior months bookings (dark green):** This is the largest and fastest-growing component, driving the majority of the overall MRR increase, especially after Month 3. By Month 12, this component is approximately $23,700.
* **Churn (brown):** This segment also increases over time, from around $50 in Month 3 to approximately $350 in Month 12. While visually stacked as part of the total bar, in the context of calculating net MRR, this component represents revenue lost or decreased, as stated in the article context: "MRR ... decreases by the churn." The chart displays its magnitude as a component of the revenue stream.

The graph on the left shows how new monthly bookings ramp, and how churn builds up over time. The graph on the right shows MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) which increases every month by the new bookings, and decreases by the churn.  For experienced SaaS business people, this MRR graph is probably obvious, however for those new to SaaS, it is worth clearly understanding the three different components of MRR.

## The Cash Flow Trough

Lets now look at the timing of sales expenses for a new sales hire, and how this creates a problem as revenue takes a while to build:

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 3/8]**

The visualization consists of two interconnected Line Graphs, side-by-side, illustrating financial metrics related to a new sales hire over time.

**Left Graph: MRR vs Expenses – New Sales Hire**
This line graph measures Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Expenses in US dollars over a 12-month period.
* The X-axis represents months, from Month 1 to Month 12.
* The Y-axis represents dollar values, ranging from $0 to $30,000, with major gridlines at $5,000 intervals.
* **MRR (green line):** Starts near $0 in Month 1 and shows a steady, linear increase, reaching approximately $2,000 in Month 1, $10,000 in Month 5, $20,000 in Month 10, and around $22,000 by Month 12.
* **Expenses (light blue line):** Begins at approximately $20,000 in Month 1, dips slightly to around $18,000 in Month 2 and 3, then flattens out to a consistent $20,000 from Month 4 through Month 12.
* **Cash Gap (shaded orange area):** A triangular region shaded in orange is labeled "Cash Gap." This area highlights the period where Expenses are greater than MRR, spanning from Month 1 until approximately Month 10, when the MRR line crosses above the Expense line.

**Right Graph: Net profit - New Sales Hire**
This line graph measures Net Profit in US dollars over a 24-month period.
* The X-axis represents months, from Month 1 to Month 24.
* The Y-axis represents dollar values, ranging from -$25,000 to $25,000, with major gridlines at $5,000 intervals. The $0 line represents breakeven.
* **Net Profit (brown line):** The line starts in negative territory, at approximately -$20,000 in Month 1. It then shows a consistent, linear increase over time.
* **Breakeven Point:** The net profit line crosses the $0 mark (breakeven) at approximately Month 11. An annotation box points to this intersection, stating "11 months to breakeven."
* **Profit Growth:** After Month 11, net profit continues to rise, reaching approximately $10,000 by Month 18 and about $20,000 by Month 24.
* A small note below the graph states: "(Slightly later breakeven point, because Gross Profit is less than MRR)".

*[Original image: https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image_thumb2.png?resize=605%2C315]*

](https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image2.png)

In the left hand graph we can see how expenses stay roughly flat, but MRR grows slowly over time. This creates the SaaS Cash Flow problem that is the main topic of this blog post.

In the right hand graph, we can see how it takes 11 months before that new sales hire breaks even, and starts contributing positively to the profit of the company. (It is very important to note that this number is going to vary greatly from one SaaS business to the next depending on the many variables used in the model.) This timing is slightly later than the cross over point on the left hand graph, due to the model showing a gross margin of 80% after taking out the cost to serve each customer.

Now lets look at how how these expenses and gross profits look on a cumulative basis:

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 4/8]**

Cumulative Line Graph titled "Cumulative Net Profit - New Sales Hire."

The graph measures cumulative net profit (in dollars) on the Y-axis against months (from Month 1 to Month 35) on the X-axis. The Y-axis ranges from -$200,000 to $400,000, with increments of $100,000.

The line representing cumulative net profit starts at $0 in Month 1, then declines into negative territory as initial investments are made. It reaches its lowest point, indicating the maximum cumulative loss (SaaS Cash Flow Trough), around Month 11-12. An annotation directly below the trough indicates "Total amount invested: $110k," aligning with the visual lowest point which is slightly below -$100,000.

After reaching this trough, the cumulative net profit begins to increase, moving back towards profitability. The line crosses the zero-dollar mark (the break-even point) at Month 23. An annotation points to this intersection, stating "23 Months to get back the investment."

Following Month 23, the cumulative net profit grows rapidly and linearly. By Month 35, the cumulative net profit reaches approximately $380,000. An annotation pointing to this steep upward trend in later months states "But a great return on investment."

In summary, the graph illustrates the typical SaaS investment pattern: an initial period of cumulative losses (the "cash flow trough") followed by a recovery to break-even, and then a period of accelerating cumulative net profit, demonstrating a strong return on the initial sales hire investment over time.

*[Original image: https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image_thumb3.png?resize=449%2C515]*

](https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image3.png)

The above chart shows clearly the size of the SaaS Cash Flow Trough ($110k in this case), and the time to recover the investment (23 months in this case).

These losses can be very concerning to an unsophisticated investor. However the chart also shows something extremely important about SaaS businesses, which is that once you have gone through the SaaS Cash Flow Trough, the profitability of that sales investment starts to soar. This graph is the key to understanding the economics of a SaaS business.

In Part 2 of this blog series, I will look at how ramping a sales force where you add multiple sales hires every month affects this trough. I will also look at the impact of collecting payment for a year in advance impacts cash flow.

## How the inputs to the model work

The starting assumptions:

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 5/8]**

Table: SaaS Model Input Variables

This table presents a set of input variables for a SaaS financial model, organized into three main categories: "Sales compensation and overhead," "On target annual bookings," and "Churn Rate and Margin." Cells highlighted in orange represent editable input values.

**1. Sales compensation and overhead:**
* **Base Compensation:** $50,000
* **Variable Compensation:** $55,000, accompanied by the note "with 50% draw for first four months."
* **Draw on Variable Comp:** A sequence of percentages across four periods, indicating a declining draw over time: 100%, 70%, 30%, and 0%.
* **Productivity Ramp:** A sequence of percentages across four periods, showing increasing productivity over time: 10%, 33%, 66%, and 100%.
* **Additional overhead:** $30,000
* **Sales attrition factor:** 15%, with a descriptive note explaining it as "a factor to discount bookings to account for failed sales hires and attrition."

**2. On target annual bookings:**
* **Annual Bookings:** $500,000 ACV (Annual Contract Value)
* **Monthly Bookings:** $41,667 ACV (Annual Contract Value)
* **Monthly Bookings:** $3,472, specified as "Billed monthly (=ACV / 12)."

**3. Churn Rate and Margin:**
* **Churn Rate (monthly):** 2.50%
* **Gross Margin:** 80.00%

The table provides a clear overview of the foundational parameters used to drive a SaaS financial model, highlighting assumptions for sales team costs, revenue generation targets, and key profitability metrics.

*[Original image: https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image_thumb4.png?resize=605%2C370]*

](https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image4.png)

This shows the input variables that are used to drive the model. Cells that are colored in Orange are input cells that can be changed to reflect your own situation.

Note the Sales attrition factor, which discounts bookings by 15% to take into account the failed sales hires, and departing sales people. It is pretty common to hear of 30% sales attrition. However since the failed sales people will still do some level of bookings, I have guessed at a number of 15% to take this into consideration.

## Marketing Funnel Economics

The next piece of the puzzle that we need to understand is how do marketing costs increase as we add sales people. Lets start by taking a look at an assumed marketing funnel:

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 6/8]**

Diagram: Marketing and Sales Funnels

This visualization displays two distinct sales and marketing funnel diagrams side-by-side, illustrating a high-level funnel on the left and a more detailed breakdown of lead flow on the right. Both funnels are depicted as a series of stacked, narrowing trapezoidal shapes, symbolizing the progression of prospects through stages and the typical reduction in volume at each subsequent stage.

The **left funnel** provides a simplified, generic view of the customer journey, with four main stages from top to bottom:
1. **Top of Funnel** (widest, grey)
2. **Middle of Funnel** (brown)
3. **Inside Sales** (green)
4. **Closed Deal** (narrowest, green)

The **right funnel** offers a more granular perspective on lead generation and conversion, detailing lead sources and specific conversion points, also from top to bottom:
1. **Visitors to Web Site** (widest, grey): This top stage is further broken down into specific sources:
* Organic Traffic (yellow box)
* SEM (Search Engine Marketing) (yellow box)
* Other Paid lead sources (yellow box)
2. **Raw Leads** (grey): This stage includes a specific subset:
* Registered Visitors (yellow box)
3. **Qualified Leads** (brown)
4. **Inside Sales** (green)
5. **Closed Deal** (narrowest, green)

Both diagrams highlight the sequential nature of the sales process, where initial broad engagement (Top of Funnel / Visitors to Web Site) gradually refines down to successful conversions (Closed Deal). The right funnel provides key insights into where leads originate (organic vs. paid) and specific conversion points such as "Registered Visitors" before leads become "Qualified Leads."

*[Original image: https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image_thumb5.png?resize=605%2C315]*

](https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image5.png)

The left hand diagram shows the main elements of the funnel, and the right hand diagram breaks down the actual flow of leads. If we look at the very top of the right hand funnel, we see that leads are assumed to come from two different types of sources: paid leads and organic leads (unpaid). The model assumes that organic (unpaid) leads tend to increase at roughly the same rate as paid leads, and allows you to set a variable which is what percentage of overall visitor traffic comes from unpaid sources. In the example data, I set this to 50%.

Below I show the part of the spreadsheet model that computes the cost of leads required to serve a new sales hire ($8,698 per month). This turns out to be very important as it is a significant cost that is frequently ignored.

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 7/8]**

Table: SaaS Marketing and Sales Lead Cost Model

This visualization presents two distinct sections of a spreadsheet model that calculates marketing efficiency and the cost of leads required to support a sales team.

**Section 1: Quick Marketing Calculation**
This section details the inputs and derived outputs for lead generation:
* **50%** amount of traffic that is organic versus paid.
* **$1.50** cost per paid visitor (e.g., Google AdWords).
* **$0.75** cost per visitor (both paid and unpaid), representing a blended average.
* **3%** visitors convert to raw leads.
* **20%** number of raw leads that turn into qualified leads.

Based on these inputs, the model calculates the following for generating one qualified lead:
* **1 qualified lead**
* **5 raw leads required**
* **167 visitors required**
* **$125** Cost of visitors (also indicated as the Cost per qualified lead).

**Section 2: Cost of Leads required to feed sales**
This section calculates the monthly cost of leads necessary to support a fully productive sales person:
* **Average Deal Size:** $6,000 (ACV) Annual Contract Value.
* **Deals to meet target:** 6.9 per month.
* **Leads to closed deal:** 10 (This implies 10 qualified leads are needed to close one deal).
* **Cost per Qualified Lead:** $125 (carried over from the "Quick Marketing Calculation" section).

Based on these parameters, the calculated **Cost of Leads required** is **$8,698 per month**, for 1 fully productive sales person.

*[Original image: https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image_thumb6.png?resize=600%2C429]*

](https://i0.wp.com/www.forentrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/image6.png)

## The model also computes CAC and LTV

The model also computes rough values for CAC (Cost of Acquiring a Customer) and LTV (Life Time Value of a Customer). These values are rough as they don't include costs for marketing staff, or sales management. (It is not too hard to add those expenses: take the monthly expense values and divide them by the number of customers acquired in that month.)

[

**[AI-Generated Image Description 8/8]**

Table.

This table presents key SaaS financial metrics: Lead Generation costs per deal, Selling costs per deal, Total Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Total Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), along with their calculated values and explanatory notes.

The table has four rows, each representing a different metric:

1. **Lead Gen costs per deal:**
* Value: $1,253
* Notes: Excludes people costs. Calculated as (Cost per qualified lead x number of leads required per closed deal).
2. **Selling costs per deal:**
* Value: $1,620
* Notes: Excludes cost of sales management.
3. **Total CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**
* Value: $2,873
* Notes: Excludes people costs in marketing and sales management. Defined as the Cost to Acquire a Customer.
4. **Total LTV (Lifetime Value):**
* Value: $16,000
* Notes: Calculated by dividing average monthly gross profit per customer (ARPU x Gross Margin) by the churn rate.

The table provides a clear breakdown of how the example company's CAC and LTV are calculated, highlighting specific exclusions in the cost calculations for a more focused understanding of direct acquisition costs.

## Conclusions

The primary purpose of this blog post is to provide entrepreneurs  who are thinking about SaaS and other recurring revenue businesses with a model that they can use to understand the impact of various different variables. (It is important not to look at the specific data that I have used to populate the example company, as this will vary greatly from one SaaS business to the next.)

The model shows us several important insights:

- How long does it take to get to breakeven

- What is the total amount of investment required (i.e. how big is the bottom of the trough)

- How long does it take to recover that investment

- How profitable the business can be over time after coming out of the trough

## What comes next: [Part 2](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-economics-2/)

In part 1, I have only discussed the data for a single sales person. In [part 2](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-economics-2/), we will look at what happens when a business reaches the stage where it has a repeatable, scalable sales model and starts to hire multiple sales people every month.

- Cash flow when hiring two salespeople per month

- Comparison of cash flow when hiring one versus two salespeople per month

- Impact on revenue of not stopping sales hiring

- Discussion of the limitations to growth

We will also look at the following additional analyses:

- Effect on cash flow of collecting a year of payments in advance.

- Effect of lower or higher churn rate
